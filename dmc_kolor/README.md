### Module dmc_kolor ###

`dmc_kolor` is a Lua module which brings back the traditional ways of describing colors using RGBA values ( eg, 255, 180, 34 ) instead of the new way using percentage values (eg, 1, .5, .25 ) brought about by the change to Graphics 2.0.

It also gives additional functionality like the ability to use names when setting object colors like "Aqua" or "Red". The module even includes color tables for all of the X11 color definitions.

**Examples**

There are examples in the folder `dmc_kolor/examples/` which show different ways to use the `dmc_kolor` library.
